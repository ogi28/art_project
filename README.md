## Introduction
This project is a full-stack website that utilizes the API of [Met Museum](https://www.metmuseum.org/) to connect users to a vast collection of art pieces. This website is built using React and NextJS, which allowed for a smooth and dynamic user experience. This website also incorporates user authentication, allowing users to create and manage their own accounts. Additionally, the website was hosted on a personal server and dockerized, providing a reliable and secure platform for users to access the art collection. This project not only provides a platform for users to discover and appreciate art but also demonstrates the use of modern web development technologies such as React and NextJS, as well as the implementation of user authentication and server-side hosting.
